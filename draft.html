  			    <p>If you decide to cooperate with us, we share it into two stages: <br />
  			      <span class="strong"> Draft Stage</span> and <span class="strong"><a href="delivery.html">Delivery Stage</a></span>.<br />
  			    </p>
                <h2><br />
                Draft Stage</h2>
                <p >First we establish the type of cooperation - we want to know if you have designated marketing person or departament
                  responsible for this cooperation and if there is already marketing strategy behind the enterprise. <br />
                  This is also the time when we sign a one-time deal contract with you. <br/>
                  If there are some defined goals, target or market reaserch done, 
                  we discuss the way of realization.
                  If you want us to look around and do some reaserch we are ready to do that. 
                  In this case we usually want to find out more about you, your products, competition and their ways of marketing products. 
                  When we know what we think we should, 
                  we contact you with some ideas and discuss it with you. 
                  Together we are going to work out the solution best suited to your situation. 
                  
                  When we come to an agreement about what it is to be done, we prepare working draft and show it to you. 
                  In case of graphic design 
                  (for print or web) our work usually embodies in two or three versions of the layout from which you are choosing one, that you like the most.
                  When it comes to web projects we show you the way to energize the design with ux elements in  static moke-ups. 
                  After discussion about the design we present dynamic moke-up, hosted on our servers and check with you if it hits marketing goals. 
                  After we come to the approval of the design, we establish delivery deadline and conclude this phase with issuing the <a href="costs.html">invoice</a>. </p>
