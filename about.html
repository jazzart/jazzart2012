  			    <h2>About us</h2>
                <p >We are passionate! But who would say she/he is not? <br />

What  can we give you that others cannot? <br />
 We measure our passion and turn it into work <br />
within reasonable boundaries. <br />
 Our main goal is to make you absolutely convinced that we are not   just heading towards completing of the task so we could issue the   invoice asap.   We want you to be sure that we spent time and thought about best way to   present your marketing idea to your target.   Most of us delt many times with situations where customer care ends with   getting fish on a hook.   We hate to be treated like that, so we really want to show our clients   different approach. <br />
We strive to keep number of our customers strictly within boundaries of our possibilities.   Main goal here is to keep creation process creative. We know that tired, overworked designer is - like any other human being -   just a tired bloke/chick, who wants to go home and rest, not to brainstorm about new exciting task at work.   That is the main reason why we want to keep expansion at low level, putting the biggest pressure on high quality,   well targeted, creative and technically perfect design.   We have decided to put quality of our work before quantity. We want you to be sure that your design is carefully prepared. <br />
We want to keep your costs at lowest possible level. <a href="costs.html">Learn how!</a><a href="file:///E:/Praca/WEB/jazzart/costs.html"></a></p>
